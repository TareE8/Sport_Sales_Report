## Project Overview

This project aims at analyzing a five years sport sales data to find insights and patterns. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and visualizations.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this analysis is to analyse sport sales for a five years period in other to identify trends, give insights and data-driven recommendations that can guide business strategies. I will be using the provided dataset to answer the following business questions.

1. How many Male and Female customers do we have?
2. Which category of product is most popular in the united state?
3. What are the top 5 products by revenue?
4. What sub category has the most order volume?
5. Which country did we generate the most revenue from?

## Data Source
The primary dataset used for this analysis was gotten from [sport_sales_data](https://kaggle.com), a csv file containing detailed information.

### Findings
1. The sales analysis shows that there were more male cusstomers than females across the five countries.
2. Also,the most popular product category was accessories.
3. The top five products by revenue were all bikes.
4. The sub category with the highest order volume was tyres and tubes.

### Recommendations
1. Countries such as Canada,France,Germany and United Kingdom with comparatively lower revenue,intensify their marketting efforts for bikes.
2. Enhance the promotion of  bikes,as this could substantially elevate total revenue.
3. Prioritize sales of accessories as seen in USA,to attract more customers and subsequently boost total revenue.
4. Enhance popularity of items within the clothing category such as vests,caps,socks and jerseeys.
Increasing their visibility and appeal could lead to a signifficant increase in their order volume as well.
